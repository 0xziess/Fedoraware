- Default config (default.seo)
- Skybox Changer
- Doubletap key
- Doubletap bar
- Dragons fury added to projectile aimbot
- "Glow" style overlay chams for viewmodels (weapon/arm)
- Brick chams (very cool)
- Other weird type of cham (also very cool)
- Cathook identifier (havent figured out how to find out if others are cathook users yet though)
- Nullcore style useful buttons panel (thanks oxygodmode)
- Directional autostrafe
- Fakelag
- Working nopush
- Kinda working fast stop for doubletap (in function autostrafe because i couldnt be bothered to put it somewhere else, so turn that on lol)
- Duck speed
- Changed world modulation to not affect the skybox
- Added a buggy dev textures thing that u need to rejoin to make work and half the time it crashes you
- Doubletap shifts 23 ticks if heavy, 20 if not
